\title{Download Oregon Canopy Height Model (CHM) Data}
\usage{
download_oregon_chm(
  aoi,
  output_path = "oregon_lidar_output.tif",
  max_tile_size = 20000,
  mask = TRUE,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{aoi}{\code{sf} or \code{sfc} object representing the area of interest}

\item{output_path}{A character string specifying the file path for the output raster (GeoTIFF). Default is \code{"esri_rest_output.tif"}.}

\item{max_tile_size}{Integer specifying the maximum size (in pixels) of each downloaded tile. Default is \code{20000}.}

\item{mask}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, the merged raster will be masked to the AOI boundary. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{quiet}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, suppresses progress messages. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} object representing the merged (and optionally masked) raster. The final raster is also saved to \code{output_path}.
}
\description{
Downloads CHM LiDAR data from DOGAMI's REST API service for a specified area of interest.
The Canopy Height Model represents the height of vegetation above ground level,
derived from the difference between Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Terrain
Model (DTM).
}
\details{
The CHM data has a 3-meter resolution and represents vegetation height in meters.
Values typically range from 0 (ground level) to 60+ meters (tall trees).
The data is provided by Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI).
